# -----------------
# 
# Fix       - there was some bug and it was fixed.
# Change    - was needed to change existing behavior or look.
# Feature   - when feature is in development process (has not been released yet).
#               Obviously use feature_name in commit description.
# API       - when you changed API of some general code that could be used in 
#               many parts. Some general code refactoring.
# Test      - when you develop tests.
# Cleanup   - when you changed some code without logic changing, just trying 
#               to make it more readable. I.e. putting some repeating code 
#               into function or method; adding var before variable if it was 
#               missed; etc. Any changes that you believe don't change the logic.
# Format    - when you change code formatting, trailing spaces, mixed spaces 
#               with tabs, anything that doesn't change code logic. 
#               Don't change code but formatting in this type of commit.
# Doc       - fix doc block comments to use in auto documentation generation.
